    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>This website was created due to a long standing problem that occured in our school. Which is that most of student entering the highschool dont actually know which academy is the best choice for us. With this it also prevent these new students from getting the benifits or oppertunities that they may have wanted just beacuse they didnt know. This is our solution. </p>
