            <h3>Natural Resources Core</h3>
                <h4>This course is designed for students who plan to pursue careers in the Natural Resources Career Pathway. Students will be
                    introduced to basic concepts in agriculture, aquaculture, earth sciences, environmental sciences, fisheries, forestry, and
                    renewable energy. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the following will be covered: 1) Scientific processes and systems,
                    2) Technology and Biotechnology, 3) Natural Resources Management, 4) Environmental Stewardship, and 5) Legal
                    Responsibilities and Ethics.</h4>
            <h3>NATURAL RESOURCES PRODUCTION I</h3>
                <h4>This course is designed to provide a comprehensive program providing students with basic knowledge and skills necessary to
                    cultivate terrestrial and/or aquatic plants and animals as they relate to natural resource careers. It emphasizes understanding
                    of systems and growing conditions necessary for a variety of plants and animals to survive and thrive. The major concepts of
                    geography, environment, organisms, remediation and management should be covered with an awareness of current
                    production in natural resource industries.</h4>
            <h3>NATURAL RESOURCES PRODUCTION II</h3>
                <h4>This course is designed to provide an in-depth program focusing on knowledge, terminology, and skills specific to selected
                    diversified Natural Resource production as they relate to Natural Resource careers. It emphasizes specific systems necessary
                    for specific species to survive and thrive and decision-making on production based on markets and consumer preference.
                    Major concepts of basic demand and supply, market forces, and consumer behavior will also be covered with an awareness of
                    current, as well as potential, natural resources goods and industry.</h4>

            <h3>NATURAL RESOURCES BIOTECHNOLOGY</h3>
                <h4>This course is designed to introduce students to different techniques used in biotechnology and genetic engineering through
                    the use of hands-on laboratory training. Students will develop extensive skills in preparing the materials and using the
                    equipment necessary in genetic research. In addition, students will obtain basic understanding of molecular biology; explore
                    different careers in the field of biotechnology; and be able to discuss the ethical issues and impact of biotechnology research
                    and its application.</h4>
            <h3>NATURAL RESOURCES BIOTECHNOLOGY II</h3>
                <h4>This course is designed to provide students with advanced technical knowledge and skills in biotechnology procedures and
                    systems. Students will research the role of biotechnology as it relates to natural resource careers and apply biotechnology
                    concepts and process skills in natural resource production and management. In addition, this course investigates real-world
                    problems related to biotechnology, current and future applications of genetic engineering, and their impacts on society. 
                    Student must have received a passing grade in biology or chemistry. Chemistry class can be concurrent.</h4>


            <h1>Environmental Resouce Management Pathway</h1>
            <h2>Classes</h2>
            <h3>Natural Resources Core</h3>
            <h3>ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <h4>This course is designed to provide a comprehensive contextual place-based program in environmental resource
                    management as it relates to Natural Resources Pathway careers. It emphasizes control, maintenance, and best practices to
                    sustain environmental and natural resource areas. The major concepts of geography, resource inventory and assessment, and
                    sustainability and stewardship should be covered with the awareness of the various industries, social, and economic activities
                    related to these areas. Examples include wind farms, forestry, and coastal water activities.</h4>
            <h3>DIRECTED STUDY IN NATURAL RESOURCES (ERM) </h3>
                <h4>This is a course for the student who needs, desires, and can profit from individual research and development projects. The
                    importance and relationship of research and development being conducted by American industry is stressed. Seminars are an
                    integral part of the program. Learning experiences include gathering of technical and scientific information, creating,
                    designing, constructing, testing, and evaluating individual or group project problems. </h4>
