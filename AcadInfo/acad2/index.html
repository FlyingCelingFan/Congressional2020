            <h3>Health Services Core</h3>
            <h4>This course is for students who plan to pursue careers in medicine, medical research, bioethics, or biotechnology. Future
                doctors, medical scientists, biologists, nurses and healthcare professionals will need to have a strong understanding of the
                human system which can include mental and physical health aspects as well as biotechnology, a new form of technology that
                will cure many diseases in future years. Students enrolled in this class will learn about human body systems, human
                pathologies, medical technology, clinical health and medical biotechnology. This class will prepare students to pursue either
                program of study within the academy of Health & Sciences. Students will be exposed to healthcare systems, legal systems,
                ethics, preventive care, and employment expectations. Students will also learn essential health care skills, including CPR,
                First Aid, communication, and professionalism. This course is a prerequisite for students pursuing clinical health & medical
                biotechnology program of study. </h4>
            <h3>Health: Today & Tomorrow</h3>
            <h3>Medical Terminology</h3>
            <h4>This semester course presents a logical, step-by-step method of learning medical terminology through programmed
                instruction. Students interested in a health-related career will gain an understanding of the medical terminology that will
                enable them to communicate more effectively in the health care setting. Coursework covers prefixes, suffixes, and word
                roots; pronunciation, spelling, and definition of selected medical words dealing with all human body systems; commonly
                used abbreviations; and the use of the medical dictionary. This course focuses on language as a communication system.
                Medical terminology skills will be reinforced in other courses found in the Health Services Career Pathway.

            <h3>Clinical Health</h3>
            <h4>This course is designed for students interested in healthcare and health careers. Using the anatomical systems as the
                framework, students will learn about common health problems for each system, as well as the various healthcare providers
                responsible for diagnosis and treatment of each system-related disease, illness, or injury. This course will combine skills and
                information common to all health careers with work-based learning experiences that will result in a career selection
                consistent with the student's aptitudes, interests, abilities, and academic achievement. Students will also learn essential health
                care skills, including CPR, First Aid, communication, and professionalism</h4>

            <h3>Medical Terminology</h3>
            <h3>Health and Nutrition I</h3>
            <h4>This course is designed to provide in-depth instruction on the relationship of food and nutrition as it relates to the health
                services careers. Laboratory experiences using food as the base will enhance learning on nutrition and healthy lifestyles. The
                major concepts of chemical and biological properties of nutrition need to be covered with basic food preparation,
                preservation, processing. The course should include the nutritional needs of individuals; physiological and psychological
                aspects of food, wellness and the prevention of disease; sanitation, safety, consumer education; and the awareness of various
                employment opportunities. </h4>
            <h3>Health and Nutrition II</h3>
            <h4>Health and Nutrition II is an advanced biological science course that integrates the concepts of science with the study of
                human nutrition. The course was designed to follow the Health and Nutrition I course and allow students to explore, more in
                depth, the topic of nutrition. The course curriculum will be career focused; students will be exposed to nutrition related jobs
                through a series of mentoring sessions and off campus field experience. Coursework will cover safety and sanitation,
                nutrition across lifespan, major body systems, energy balance, health and weight management, eating disorders and career
                paths in the food and nutrition industry. Students will have the opportunity to meet with industry professionals and gain
                insight into jobs in the field of nutrition/health. Please note that this course requires a minimum of 20 hours off campus field
                experience. As part of the curriculum, students will be required to go through a diet analysis to evaluate their own personal
                health. They will be required to identify deficiencies and reflect on ways to improve their overall health. Once this has been
                successfully completed, students will coach someone outside of the classroom. </h4>
